# tour-guide

Tour Guide app can list tours around a city which can be picked by searching. 
Given static values as places array since Google API cannot be used right now. As you pick a place form the recents or top searches, the tours are fetched according to the latitude and longitude given.

By calling Google places API and autocomplete API, we can get the details of the selected location and then fetch all the tour with location id, lat and lon.

You can refer master branch for the latest updates.
